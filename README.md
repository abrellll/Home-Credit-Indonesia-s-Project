Created by Abrilian Maulidhia

**Objectives:**
Identified characteristics of clients who have difficulty in repaying the loans.
Implemented machine learning algorithms to predict client’s repayment abilities.
**Results:**
The most important features to determine whether the client is having difficulty repaying the loan are score from external data source 2, score from external data source 3, client's age in days, days ID publish, and days registration
The best model to predict client’s repayment abilities is Random Forest model.
Tool: Python.
